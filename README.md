## :book: What I learned

How to delay a function call deliberately

```
const asyncTimeout = ms => {
		return new Promise(resolve => {
			setTimeout(resolve, ms)
		})
	}
```

Call this function in any other function with desired `ms` argument.For example `asyncTimeout(1000)`

```
	const getAdvice = async () => {
			setLoading(true)
			await asyncTimeout(500)
			const data = await fetch(adviceUrl)
			const advice = await data.json()
			setLoading(false)
			setAdvice(advice.slip.advice)
			setAdviceNumber(advice.slip.id)
	                }
```

`asyncTimeout` function makes sure `getAdvice` function will be delayed for at least 0.5 seconds

### :house: Development
